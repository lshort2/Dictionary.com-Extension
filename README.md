## What is this?
- This is an updated version of one of my long time favorite extensions for Google Chrome.
- The original version released by the Dictionary.com is old and no longer updated, meaning it is not supported by many modern web browsers (as of September 19, 2017).
- The purpose of this project is to update it to Manifest version 2.0, that way I can use it on my Linux desktop at home.
