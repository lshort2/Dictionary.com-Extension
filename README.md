# Dictionary.com-Extension
Dictionary.com extension for Google Chrome!
## What is this?
This is an updated version of one of my long time favorite extensions for Google Chrome.
The original version released by the Dictionary.com is old and no longer updated, meaning it is not supported by many modern web browsers (as of September 19, 2017).
The purpose of this project is to update it to Manifest version 2.0, that way I can use it on my Linux desktop at home.
